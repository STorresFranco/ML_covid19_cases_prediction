# ü¶† COVID-19 Cases Forecast in England

**Project Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed | üîÅ Auto-Retraining via GitHub Actions

In this project, I develop a model capable of forecasting aggregated COVID-19 cases over a 7-day window using real data from public APIs. The data includes daily positive COVID-19 case counts in England and meteorological information from a specific location in the country. Throughout the project, I explored the potential relationship between COVID-19 cases and meteorological variables to improve model performance. The acceptance criterion for the model was an R¬≤ score above 0.7.

## üìä Prototype

The prototyping phase involved collecting one year of historical daily data (from April 2024 to May 2025) from public sources:

* **COVID-19 Data:** Positive case counts
* **Weather Data:** Minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, accumulated precipitation, snowfall, and max wind speed

The following steps were carried out:

* Data cleaning and statistical exploration, including stationarity testing
* Feature engineering to derive meaningful explanatory variables:

  * Lagged COVID-19 case values (t-1 to t-8)
  * Temperature range and rolling means
  * Fourier components to model seasonality
* Feature selection based on correlation and cointegration with the target
* Model selection using walk-forward validation and Bayesian optimization via Optuna (XGBoost vs. LightGBM)
* Model tuning based on feature importance analysis

## üîß Modeling Conclusions

* ‚úÖ **XGBoost** was selected as the final model due to superior performance
* ‚ùå No significant correlation was found between weather data and case counts
* üîπ The most relevant features were lagged COVID-19 cases from t-3 to t-8
* ‚≠ê Achieved R¬≤ Score: **0.77**

## üîÑ How the Model Works

* Daily case data is retrieved from a GitHub-hosted CSV
* Lag and rolling features are dynamically calculated
* Model retrains automatically only if R¬≤ ‚â• 0.70
* Updated model is served via Streamlit frontend

## üí° Model Features

* **üìä Model:** XGBoost Regressor trained on lagged COVID-19 case data
* **üîÅ CI/CD:** Automated retraining via GitHub Actions
* **üåç Live Data:** Integrated with [UKHSA](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/)
* **üìâ Engineered Features:**

  * 7-day rolling case sums
  * Lag variables: t-3 to t-8
* **üì¶ Deployment:** Publicly accessible Streamlit app

## üåü Highlights

One of the most compelling aspects of this project is the **hyperparameter tuning using Optuna** in combination with **walk-forward validation**, mimicking cross-validation in a time-series context.

R¬≤ was chosen over RMSE/MSE to maintain performance balance between case spikes and troughs. RMSE/MSE would bias the model toward minimizing errors during peaks only.
